{{! <!--
  Okay, let's set up a SKILLS section, front and center.

  We could do this manually with custom HTML, but let's take advantage of
  some predefined partials instead. FRESH provides global partials for all
  resume sections (employment, skills, education, speaking, etc.). They're
  named like this:

      section/skills
      section/employment
      section/service
      section/recognition
      etc..

  So what we want to do is inject the "section/skills" global partial
  and use it here in our theme. We can do that simply with:

      ((> section/skills ))

  However, in this case we also want to override the heading icon used
  in the global partial. So we also declare what's known as an INLINE
  PARTIAL, using ((#*inline "icon-skills")), and set its content to the
  icon we'd like to display for the SKILLS section. The global partial
  will reference this template by name, so it allows us to selectively
  override that part of the global partial.
--> }}

{{#*inline "icon-skills"}}<span class="fa fa-lg fa-code"></span>{{/inline}}
{{> section/skills _icon="icon-skills"}}

{{! <!--
  We'll override all section heading icons the same way, for the rest of the
  resume, using the same inline template technique. Keep in mind that these
  inline templates do not, by themselves, create any markup. They emit markup
  only when referenced by another template. Which template? In this case, the
  global partial for each section. Defined elsewhere.
--> }}

{{#*inline "icon-employment"}}<span class="fa fa-building"></span>{{/inline}}
{{#*inline "icon-projects"}}<span class="fa fa-star"></span>{{/inline}}
{{#*inline "icon-education"}}<span class="fa fa-mortar-board"></span>{{/inline}}
{{#*inline "icon-service"}}<span class="fa fa-child"></span>{{/inline}}
{{#*inline "icon-samples"}}<span class="fa fa-share"></span>{{/inline}}
{{#*inline "icon-writing"}}<span class="fa fa-pencil"></span>{{/inline}}
{{#*inline "icon-recognition"}}<span class="fa fa-trophy"></span>{{/inline}}
{{#*inline "icon-speaking"}}<span class="fa fa-users"></span>{{/inline}}
{{#*inline "icon-testimonials"}}<span class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up"></span>{{/inline}}
{{#*inline "icon-references"}}<span class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up"></span>{{/inline}}

{{! <!--

  Now let's set up the EMPLOYMENT section. Similar to the SKILLS section above,
  we'll use a global partial. But for the Compact theme, we want a bit different
  structure than the default section/employment partial gives us, so we'll
  need to cut a little deeper with our partial overriding strategy. Each
  predefined section partial references (and provides a default value for)
  a "body-[sectionName]" partial. For the employment section, it's called
  "body-employment". To override it, all we have to do is declare it inline.

  Again, this does not actually render any markup. This declares a template
  that can be referenced somewhere else to render markup. We are just
  overriding the global section partial's idea of what the "body-employment"
  fragment should look like.
